# National Park Picker

Find out which American national park(s) you would most like to visit.  All national parks are displayed via Google Maps.  Select a marker to see an extract of the park's Wikipedia article.

## Run the Application

The application can be opened on [GitHub Pages](https://jnpj1.github.io/national-park-finder/).  Alternatively, open the index.html file in your web browser.

### Opening a Park Information Window

Select a park in one of two ways:
* Click directly on a marker.  Mouse over the park if you would like to see its name first.
* Click on the park listing in the sidebar.

### Searching for a Park by Name

Search for a park by a full or partial name (i.e. 'Big Bend' or 'cave').  Submit by hitting the enter key or clicking the 'Find Park!' button.

### Reset all Map Filters

Use the 'Clear Filters' button to reset a map filtered by favorites or by search terms.  All park listings and markers will reappear.

### Open/Close Sidebar

Click the hamburger at top right to open or close the sidebar.  Sidebar will automatically open on page load on larger devices.
